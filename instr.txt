The Board#RThe coloured circles are the players, the blue squares are indestructable blocks, the grey squares are destructable bricks. The big red plus is an explosion caused by a bomb. The little grey circles are bombs.
Bricks#RWhen a box appears that is partially clear.#RThese boxes are Called bricks which are destructible and contain pick ups. The Bricks can be walked through until they become Solid. If you are standing on top of a brick when it becomes Solid, you will lose a life and possibly Die! 
Pickups#RBy destroying the grey bricks you release "pick ups". There are 3 types of pickups: BombUPs, which increase the amount of bombs you can drop, PowerUPs, which increase the power of your bombs and LifeUPs, which are rare items that give you an extra life.
Bomb Kicks#RIf you are next to a bomb and you move towards it you kick the bomb across the screen.
Explosions#RIf you are hit by an explosion you die. When you are dead you can travel through anything on the board and become indestructible. You cannot drop bombs and you destroy pickups on touch.
